# CareerFoundry Challenge

On this page you can see the available courses provided by the api.
By clicking the learn more button further course information will be shown.

## Improvements in case more time was given.

- Move API requests in a separate folder.
  - Each request single responsibility.
  - Test using jest or a similar framework
- Use a framework like react or flutter so that i can easily structure components, pages and routing.
  - Example: main that calls individual components such as course cards.
  - Also testing components using jest.
- Semantics
- better positioning, formatting and display "upcoming start dates".
- Make the page more adaptive.
- Improve the style in direction of CareerFoundry website style.
- Use async / await rather tham ".then"
